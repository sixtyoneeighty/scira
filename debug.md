Let's break down this issue and address both the console errors and the \`useChat\` configuration with respect to the Vercel AI SDK guide for Gemini.

\*\*Analysis of the Errors\*\*

1\. \*\*\`content.js:26 Feature is disabled\`\*\*: This message typically originates from a browser extension, most likely a content blocker or privacy-focused extension. It indicates that the extension has intervened and disabled a specific feature it detected on the page. This is likely not directly related to your core application logic but might affect the user experience.

2\. \*\*\`Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: https://mojo.sixtyoneeightyai.com/favicon.ico (Resource size is not correct \- typo in the Manifest?)\`\*\*: This error suggests an issue with your \`manifest.webmanifest\` file, specifically regarding the \`favicon.ico\` declaration. The browser is unable to use the specified icon, likely due to a mismatch in the declared size and the actual size of the icon file.

3\. \*\*\`app-index.tsx:25 Error Object:\`\*\* and \*\*\`Could not load content for webpack://\_N\_E/src/client/app-index.tsx\`\*\*: These errors, combined with the stack trace, point to a problem occurring within your \`useChat\` hook's \`onError\` callback. The "Unsupported URL scheme" error, in particular, is often associated with issues in source maps or module resolution during development. The fact that it can't load content for \`app-index.tsx\` suggests a potential build or bundling issue.

4\. \*\*Vercel Logs\*\*: The Vercel logs you provided indicate that the API routes and static assets are being served correctly (with \`200\` and \`206\` status codes). This aligns with your deduction that the issue is likely client-side.

\*\*Addressing the Errors\*\*

1\. \*\*\`content.js:26\`\*\*:  
    \*   \*\*Action:\*\* Advise users to check their browser extensions. If possible, identify the specific feature being blocked and provide guidance on how to allow it for your site if it's essential for functionality.

2\. \*\*\`manifest.webmanifest\` Icon Error\*\*:  
    \*   \*\*Action:\*\*  
        1\. \*\*Verify Icon Size:\*\* Ensure that your \`favicon.ico\` file actually exists at the specified path and that it conforms to the sizes declared in your \`manifest.webmanifest\`. Use an icon editor or online tool to check the dimensions.  
        2\. \*\*Correct Manifest:\*\* Update the \`sizes\` attribute in your \`manifest.webmanifest\` to accurately reflect the dimensions of your \`favicon.ico\`.  
        3\. \*\*Caching:\*\* Clear your browser cache or use hard reloading to ensure the updated manifest and icon are fetched.

3\. \*\*\`app-index.tsx\` Errors and \`onError\` Callback\*\*:  
    \*   \*\*Action:\*\*  
        1\. \*\*Source Maps:\*\*  
            \*   \*\*Check \`next.config.mjs\`:\*\* You have \`productionBrowserSourceMaps: true\`. This is generally good for debugging in production, but it might be related to the "Unsupported URL scheme" error.  
            \*   \*\*Experiment:\*\* Try temporarily setting \`productionBrowserSourceMaps: false\` in your \`next.config.mjs\` to see if it resolves the source map issue. If it does, you might need to investigate your source map configuration further.  
        2\. \*\*\`onError\` Logic:\*\*  
            \*   \*\*Review:\*\* Carefully examine the code inside your \`onError\` callback. The error is being triggered there. Look for any operations that might be causing issues, especially those involving network requests or DOM manipulation.  
            \*   \*\*Simplify:\*\* Try commenting out parts of the \`onError\` logic to isolate the problematic section.  
        3\. \*\*\`useChat\` Configuration:\*\* (We'll address this in more detail in the next section).  
        4\. \*\*Zod Schemas:\*\* You are using Zod schemas for validation. Ensure that all schemas are correctly defined and that the data received from the API calls conforms to the expected structure.  
        5\. \*\*Error Handling in \`POST\`:\*\* Review the \`POST\` handler in \`app/api/chat/route.ts\`. Make sure that you are handling all potential errors correctly, especially if any \`await\` calls might throw.

\*\*\`useChat\` Configuration and Vercel AI SDK Guide\*\*

Let's analyze your \`useChat\` configuration and how it relates to the Vercel AI SDK guide for using Gemini:

\*\*Your \`useChat\` Configuration:\*\*

\`\`\`typescript  
const { isLoading, input, messages, setInput, append, handleSubmit, setMessages, reload, stop } \= useChat({  
    maxSteps: 8,  
    body: {  
        model: selectedModel,  
        group: selectedGroup,  
    },  
    onFinish: async (message, { finishReason }) \=\> {  
        console.log("\[finish reason\]:", finishReason);  
        if (message.content && finishReason \=== 'stop' || finishReason \=== 'length') {  
            const newHistory \= \[...messages, { role: "user", content: lastSubmittedQueryRef.current }, { role: "assistant", content: message.content }\];  
            const { questions } \= await suggestQuestions(newHistory);  
            setSuggestedQuestions(questions);  
        }  
    },  
    onError: (error: ChatError, context?: ChatErrorContext) \=\> {  
        // ... (Your error handling logic) ...  
    },  
});  
\`\`\`

\*\*Key Points and Recommendations\*\*

1\. \*\*\`maxSteps: 8\`\*\*: This limits the number of steps in a multi-step tool call. If your tool calls involve more than 8 steps, you might need to increase this.

2\. \*\*\`body: { model: selectedModel, group: selectedGroup }\`\*\*:  
    \*   You are correctly passing the \`model\` and \`group\` to your API route.  
    \*   \*\*\`selectedModel\`\*\*: You have \`gemini-2.0-flash-exp\` as the default. Ensure this model is available in your environment. The documentation might refer to a different model name.  
    \*   \*\*\`group\`\*\*: This is a custom parameter you are using to select the appropriate tools and system prompt. This is a good approach for organizing your logic.

3\. \*\*\`onFinish\`\*\*:  
    \*   You are correctly handling the \`stop\` and \`length\` finish reasons.  
    \*   You are using \`suggestQuestions\` to generate follow-up questions. This is a good use case.

4\. \*\*\`onError\`\*\*:  
    \*   You are logging the error details, which is good for debugging.  
    \*   You are showing a user-friendly error message using \`toast.error\`.

\*\*Vercel AI SDK Guide for Gemini\*\*

The Vercel AI SDK guide for Gemini provides examples for setting up the provider and using it with the SDK. Here's how your code aligns with the guide:

1\. \*\*Provider Setup:\*\*

    \`\`\`typescript  
    // In your API route (e.g., app/api/chat/route.ts)  
    import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';

    const model \= google('gemini-2.0-flash-exp', { // Or your chosen model  
        apiKey: serverEnv.GEMINI\_API\_KEY,  
        // ... other options  
    });  
    \`\`\`

    \*   You are correctly initializing the \`google\` provider with your API key.  
    \*   \*\*Model Name:\*\* Double-check that \`gemini-2.0-flash-exp\` is the correct model name. The guide might use \`gemini-2.0-flash-exp\` or a similar name.

2\. \*\*Using the Model with \`streamText\`:\*\*

    \`\`\`typescript  
    import { streamText } from 'ai';

    // ... inside your POST handler ...

    const result \= streamText({  
        model,  
        messages: convertToCoreMessages(messages), // Assuming you have this function  
        // ... other options like temperature, tools, etc.  
    });

    return result.toDataStreamResponse();  
    \`\`\`

    \*   You are using \`streamText\` correctly.  
    \*   \*\*\`convertToCoreMessages\`:\*\* Ensure this function properly transforms your messages into the format expected by the Gemini API.  
    \*   \*\*\`smoothStream\`:\*\* You are using \`smoothStream\` for a smoother streaming experience. This is a good practice.

\*\*Recommendations for Debugging\*\*

1\. \*\*Simplify \`onError\`:\*\* Temporarily remove or comment out parts of your \`onError\` logic to isolate the cause of the "Unsupported URL scheme" error. Start with a minimal \`onError\` that just logs the error.

2\. \*\*Check Source Maps:\*\* If disabling \`productionBrowserSourceMaps\` helps, investigate your source map configuration. Ensure that your source maps are being generated correctly and are accessible to the browser.

3\. \*\*Inspect Network Requests:\*\* Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the requests made by your \`useChat\` hook. Look for any failed requests or unexpected responses.

4\. \*\*Log More in \`POST\` Handler:\*\* Add more \`console.log\` statements to your \`app/api/chat/route.ts\` to track the flow of execution and the values of variables. This will help you pinpoint where errors might be occurring.

5\. \*\*Test with a Minimal Example:\*\* Create a very simple \`useChat\` example that just sends a basic message and receives a response. This will help you determine if the issue is with your core \`useChat\` setup or with something specific to your more complex logic.

6\. \*\*Verify Zod Schema:\*\* Double-check your Zod schemas to ensure they are correctly parsing the data returned by the tools.

\*\*Example of a Minimal \`useChat\` Example\*\*

\`\`\`typescript  
import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

export default function SimpleChat() {  
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } \= useChat({  
    api: '/api/chat', // Your API route  
    body: {  
      model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp', // Use the model name from the guide  
    },  
  });

  return (  
    \<div\>  
      {messages.map((m) \=\> (  
        \<div key={m.id}\>  
          {m.role}: {m.content}  
        \</div\>  
      ))}

      \<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}\>  
        \<input  
          value={input}  
          onChange={handleInputChange}  
          placeholder="Say something..."  
        /\>  
        \<button type="submit"\>Send\</button\>  
      \</form\>  
    \</div\>  
  );  
}  
\`\`\`

\*\*In \`app/api/chat/route.ts\` (Simplified):\*\*

\`\`\`typescript  
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';  
import { experimental\_StreamData, streamText } from 'ai';  
import { serverEnv } from '@/env/server';

export async function POST(req: Request) {  
  const { messages, model } \= await req.json();

  const gemini \= google('gemini-2.0-flash-exp', {  
    apiKey: serverEnv.GEMINI\_API\_KEY,  
  });

  const result \= await streamText({  
    model: gemini,  
    messages,  
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();  
}  
\`\`\`

By carefully reviewing your code, simplifying your error handling, and comparing your implementation to the Vercel AI SDK guide, you should be able to track down and resolve the bug. Remember to use your browser's developer tools and logging to gain more insights into the problem.
